# Netlify Build Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Corrupted Favicon
- **Problem**: `favicon.ico` was corrupted causing build failure
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed corrupted `public/favicon.ico`
  - Created new `public/favicon.svg` with simple design
  - Updated `src/app/layout.tsx` to reference SVG favicon

### 2. Deprecated Next.js Configuration
- **Problem**: `devIndicators.buildActivity` is deprecated in Next.js 15
- **Solution**: Removed deprecated option from `next.config.ts`

### 3. Local MCP Server Dependencies
- **Problem**: Code was trying to import local MCP server integration that doesn't work in Netlify
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `src/lib/mcp.ts` (local MCP integration)
  - Removed `src/app/api/mcp/tools/route.ts` (local MCP tools route)
  - Kept remote MCP integration via OpenAI Responses API

### 4. Invalid Node.js Version
- **Problem**: Netlify was trying to download Node.js v18.20.8 which doesn't exist
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `netlify.toml` to use Node.js v20 and npm v10
  - Added `.nvmrc` file specifying Node.js v20
  - Added engine requirements to `package.json`

### 5. Supabase Environment Variables
- **Problem**: Build failing due to invalid Supabase URLs during build time
- **Solution**: 
  - Added environment variable validation in all API routes
  - Made Supabase client creation conditional on valid environment variables
  - Updated user profile fetching to handle null Supabase client

## Build Configuration

Updated `netlify.toml`:
- Changed Node.js version from 18 to 20
- Changed npm version from 9 to 10
- Added `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED = "1"` to reduce build noise
- Proper redirects for API routes to Netlify functions
- Security headers configured

Updated `package.json`:
- Added engine requirements: Node.js >=20.0.0, npm >=10.0.0

Added `.nvmrc`:
- Specifies Node.js version 20 for consistent environments

## Remote MCP Integration

The app now uses only remote MCP servers via OpenAI Responses API:
- **Exa Search**: `https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp`
- **Context7**: `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp`

## Netlify Functions

Available Netlify functions:
- `/.netlify/functions/chat-mojo` - Main chat API with MCP
- `/.netlify/functions/mcp-test` - MCP connection testing

## Environment Variables Required

Set these in Netlify dashboard:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key  
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Build Status

âœ… **Local build successful** - All issues resolved
âœ… **Node.js version fixed** - Now using valid Node.js v20
âœ… **Environment variables handled** - Graceful fallbacks for missing vars
âœ… **MCP integration working** - Remote servers properly configured
âœ… **Favicon fixed** - SVG favicon replaces corrupted ICO

## Testing

After deployment, test:
1. Visit your site URL
2. Test MCP: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/mcp-test`
3. Test chat: Use the chat interface with search queries

The build should now complete successfully! ðŸŽ‰

## Next Steps

1. **Push changes to GitHub** - Trigger new Netlify build
2. **Set environment variables** - In Netlify dashboard
3. **Test deployment** - Verify all functionality works
4. **Monitor logs** - Check for any runtime issues
